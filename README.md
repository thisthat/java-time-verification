# Type System

Currently we defined two different types:
* `Timestamp`
* `Duration`
* `Unknown`
* `Warning` -> Only used to return error

Based on these types, we define a set of rules to process Java-like expressions to infer those types from normal 
integer variables.

## Timestamp
The type `Timestamp` defines that a variable hold a time value that refers to a specific point in time.

## Duration
The type `Duration` is used to define that a variable holds a time value that specifies a quantum (amount) of time.

## Unknown
The type `Unkown` is used as base type for parameter. Analyzing the source code we can derive the correct type of it.

## Warning
The type `Warning` is used to stop the processing and return a warning to developers because they are doing smth wrong.

# Type System

## Definitions

Every Java statement that alter a value of a variable is in the form:

$` variable_name = expression `$

We call this form **assignment** and every Java statements that alter a variable value is mapped in this form: *e.g.* assignment and variable initialization.
The LHS of an assignment is _**always**_ a variable name. In the RHS, we use the term **value** to refer to the value associated to every operand of the expression, 

We process the `expression` (RHS) following the Java semantics of expression resolution (recursively on subexpression) and we determine its time type. 
We then mark the `variable_name` with the time type of the expression.

## Base Case
We define how determine `Timestamp` value using the time semantics defined in [1].
When we encounter a method call to an **RT** method, we say it is a `Timestamp` value.
When in the analysis we encounter a scalar value, we mark it as `Duration` type.
Every parameter is initially defined as `Unknown`. Analyzing the source code we can 
instantiate to its correct type.

These rules are correct under the assumption that developers do not hard-encode timestamp 
values in source code but only duration values. They rely on Java APIs to determine timestamps.


# Inductive Case

We use the following notation in the equations:
1. `Timestamp`: T 
2. `Duration`: D
2. `Warning`: W
We assume that each rule is composed of expression of which we have already resolved the type.
The proof of convergence it is a trivial proof on the size of expression.

The possible cases are (we exclude the symmetric cases):
* $`T + T \prec W`$
* $`T - T \prec D`$
* $`T \times T \prec W`$
* $`T \div T \prec W`$

* $`T + D \prec T`$
* $`T - D \prec T`$
* $`T \times D \prec W`$
* $`T \div D \prec W`$

* $`D + D \prec D`$
* $`D - D \prec D`$
* $`D \times D \prec D`$
* $`D \div D \prec D`$

* $`max(T,T) \prec T`$
* $`max(T,D) \prec W`$
* $`max(D,D) \prec D`$
* $`min(T,T) \prec T`$
* $`min(T,D) \prec W`$
* $`min(D,D) \prec D`$


Here the rules for instantiating the unknown. We can **NOT** assume the symmetric property but we assume it is always the correct operation:
 
* $`T + U       \Rightarrow U \prec D`$
* $`T - U       \Rightarrow U \prec D`$
* $`T \times U  \Rightarrow U \prec W`$
* $`T \div U    \Rightarrow U \prec W`$

* $`D + U       \Rightarrow U \prec T`$
* $`D - U       \Rightarrow U \prec D`$
* $`D \times U  \Rightarrow U \prec D`$
* $`D \div U    \Rightarrow U \prec D`$

* $`U + T       \Rightarrow U \prec D`$ 
* $`U - T       \Rightarrow U \prec T`$
* $`U \times T  \Rightarrow U \prec W`$
* $`U \div T    \Rightarrow U \prec W`$

* $`U + D       \Rightarrow U \prec U`$
* $`U - D       \Rightarrow U \prec U`$
* $`U \times D  \Rightarrow U \prec D`$
* $`U \div D    \Rightarrow U \prec D`$


* $`max(T,U) \Rightarrow U \prec T`$
* $`max(D,U) \Rightarrow U \prec D`$
* $`min(T,U) \Rightarrow U \prec T`$
* $`min(D,U) \Rightarrow U \prec D`$

Method Calls of **ET** methods [1], we say that the parameter type **MUST** be of type $`K`$ based on our manual analysis,
where $`K`$ is either $`T`$ or $`D`$.

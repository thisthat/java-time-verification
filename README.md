# Type System

Currently we defined two different types:
* `Timestamp`
* `Duration`

Based on these types, we define a set of rules to process Java-like expressions to infer those types from normal 
integer variables.

## Timestamp
The type `Timestamp` defines that a variable hold a time value that refers to a specific point in time.

## Duration
The type `Duration` is used to define that a variable holds a time value that specifies a quantum (amount) of time.


# Type System

$`f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty
     \hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}
     \,d\xi`$

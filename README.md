# Type System

Currently we defined two different types:
* `Timestamp`
* `Duration`
* `Unknown`
* `Warning` -> Only used to return error

Based on these types, we define a set of rules to process Java-like expressions to infer those types from normal 
integer variables.

## Timestamp
The type `Timestamp` defines that a variable hold a time value that refers to a specific point in time.

## Duration
The type `Duration` is used to define that a variable holds a time value that specifies a quantum (amount) of time.

## Unknown
The type `Unkown` is used as base type for parameter. Analyzing the source code we can derive the correct type of it.

## Warning
The type `Warning` is used to stop the processing and return a warning to developers because they are doing smth wrong.

# Type System

## Definitions

Every Java statement that alter a value of a variable is in the form:

$` variable_name = expression `$

We call this form **assignment** and every Java statements that alter a variable value is mapped in this form: *e.g.* assignment and variable initialization.
The LHS of an assignment is _**always**_ a variable name. In the RHS, we use the term **value** to refer to the value associated to every operand of the expression, 

We process the `expression` (RHS) following the Java semantics of expression resolution (recursively on subexpression) and we determine its time type. 
We then mark the `variable_name` with the time type of the expression.

## Base Case
We define how determine `Timestamp` value using the time semantics defined in [1].
When we encounter a method call to an **RT** method, we say it is a `Timestamp` value.
When in the analysis we encounter a scalar value, we mark it as `Duration` type.
Every parameter is initially defined as `Unknown`. Analyzing the source code we can 
instantiate to its correct type.

These rules are correct under the assumption that developers do not hard-encode timestamp values in source code but only duration values.
They rely on Java APIs to determine timestamps.


# Inductive Case

We use the following notation in the equations:
1. `Timestamp`: T 
2. `Duration`: D
2. `Warning`: W
We assume that each rule is composed of expression of which we have already resolved the type.
The proof of convergence it is a trivial proof on the size of expression.

The possible cases are (we exclude the symmetric cases):
* $`T \bigodot T \prec T`$
* $`T \bigodot D \prec T`$
* $`D \bigodot D \prec D`$
* $`max(T,T) \prec T`$
* $`max(T,D) \prec W`$
* $`max(D,D) \prec D`$
* $`min(T,T) \prec T`$
* $`min(T,D) \prec W`$
* $`min(D,D) \prec D`$

Here the rules for instantiating the unknown.
* $`T \bigodot U \prec T`$
* $`T \bigodot U \prec T`$
* $`D \bigodot U \prec D`$
* $`max(T,U) \prec T`$
* $`max(D,U) \prec D`$
* $`min(T,U) \prec T`$
* $`min(D,U) \prec D`$



Where $`\bigodot \in \{ +, -, /, \times, \div \}`$

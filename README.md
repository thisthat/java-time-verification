# Type System

Currently we defined two different types:
* `Timestamp`
* `Duration`

Based on these types, we define a set of rules to process Java-like expressions to infer those types from normal 
integer variables.

## Timestamp
The type `Timestamp` defines that a variable hold a time value that refers to a specific point in time.

## Duration
The type `Duration` is used to define that a variable holds a time value that specifies a quantum (amount) of time.


# Type System

## Definitions

Every Java statement that alter a value of a variable is in the form:

$` variable_name = expression `$

We call this form **assignment** and every Java statements that alter a variable value is mapped in this form: *e.g.* assignment and variable initialization.
The LHS of an assignment is _**always**_ a variable name. In the RHS, we use the term **value** to refer to the value associated to every operand of the expression, 

We process the `expression` (RHS) following the Java semantics of expression resolution (recursively on subexpression) and we determine its time type. 
We then mark the `variable_name` with the time type of the expression.

## Base Case
We define how determine `Timestamp` value using the time semantics defined in [1].
When we encounter a method call to an **RT** method, we say it is a `Timestamp` value.
When in the analysis we encounter a scalar value, we mark it as `Duration` type.

These rules are correct under the assumption that developers do not hard-encode timestamp values in source code but only duration values.
They rely on Java APIs to determine timestamps.


# Inductive Case

The possible cases are (we exclude the symmetric cases):
* $``Timestamp` \bigodot `Timestamp` \prec `Timestamp``$
* $``Timestamp` \bigodot `Duration`  \prec `Timestamp``$
